                  <p>I first met Dennie in 2016 when we were still high school students. We discovered our shared interest in Minecraft game servers and immediately set our plans into motion. That's how BattleAsya was founded. It was truly a pleasure to learn, develop, and manage our server under Dennie's guidance.</p>
                  <p>Dennie is an inspiring, charismatic, and great leader. Under his leadership, BattleAsya became one of the most popular Minecraft servers in Southeast Asia. The success of BattleAsya wouldn't have been possible without Dennie's dedication and commitment.</p>

                    BattleAsya was a non-profit organization managed by dedicated volunteers who operated a medium-sized Minecraft server serving Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, BattleAsya ceased operations in 2023.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Origin of Inception</b><br>
                    In 2016, BattleAsya was born from a spontaneous idea shared among me and some online friends. Our vision was simple: to provide Minecraft players in SEA with a low-latency multiplayer gaming option. As we devoted more time and energy, the venture grew significantly in 2021, becoming one of the most prominent and well-known Minecraft servers and communities across Southeast Asia.

                    <p>I was tasked with maintaining the company's ERP system, which proved challenging due to its aged framework (LAMP ES5) and absence of documentation.</p>
                    <p>I meticulously examined the entire database structure and interface code to gradually reverse-engineer the underlying business logic.</p>
                    <p>Based on my findings, I proposed revamping the system with new functions and interfaces. My seniors, including the GM and MD, were genuinely pleased with the proposal and the revitalized outcomes.</p>

                    <p>3D models were created using SketchUp or Blender; UV mappings were done on AutoDesk 3Ds Max or Blender; Textures were completed using Photoshop or Photopea. Each project consumed around 5 - 7 days to complete.</p>

                    <p>The final year group project was about building a voice-controlled smart instrument that is able to react accurately to a set of predefined wake words and commands.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <p>Technology used</p>
                      <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
                      <li>Tensorflow, Keras API for model building</li>
                      <li>Librosa for audio resampling</li>
                      <li>Python Speech Features for features extracting</li>
                      <li>NumPy, matplotlib for Graph Plotting</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We first defined a set of verbal commands and wake words to be used in the project. We made use of the Google speech recognition dataset to construct our very first audio sample library.</p>
                    <p>We then built the recognition models by applying several pre-processing and machine-learning techniques.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Feature Extraction: Mel-Frequency Cepstrumc (MFCC)</li>
                      <li>Model building: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Speaker independent</li>
                      <li>Model building: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) - Speaker dependent</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After generating the models, we developed several python algorithms that compare the trained models with processed inputs for results prediction.</p>
                    <p>Raspberry Pi was used as an edge device for housing the entire python-driven recognition system (listener, predictor, feature extractor, resampler, and trained models). The device interfaced with an instrument to offer voice-controlled smart capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Since the edge device come without a display, we developed an Android mobile app using MIT App Inventor to provide users with a simple graphical interface to interact with the system.</p>
                    <p>When a user speaks, the speaker on Raspberry Pi or mobile app captures the audio signals. The system then processes the data by performing MFCC feature extraction. Once the feature is extracted, it is compared with the pre-trained models. The results will then be displayed on the mobile app (communication via SSH), and will be used to signal the interfaced instrument (e.g., turning lights on).</p>
                    <p>Throughout the project, we achieved goals, composed reports, and learned techniques together as a team.</p>

                  <div>
                    <p>First released in 2013 and last updated in 2014, Admin360 was originally an abandoned Minecraft Java plugin developed by vidhu1911.</p>
                    <p>The plugin introduces a helpdesk system to Minecraft that poses a stronger focus on real-time interactions rather than contactless "ticket" processing. Maybe the original author isn't aware of how useful the idea is, but the concept was pretty well needed for small servers at the time (including my server).</p>
                    <p>At the time when I wanted to make use of the plugin, it was already 2 years since the author's inactivity. Very unfortunately, during that period of time, Minecraft went through several big updates that broke some of the legacy codes in the plugin. Due to my strong interest in the project, I decided to fork it, fix the defective parts and share it with others. That's how the reloaded version came into place in 2016.</p>
                    <p>The new version continued Admin360's philosophy with extensive enhancement in code, performance, customizability, and functions. The improvements were mostly done based on the established framework.</p>
                    <p>To be in line with modern Minecraft and Java standards, the legacy code base has been drastically revitalised throughout the years. About twice to thrice the number of new features was added to the system as an answer to the growing needs. At the time of 2021, the original framework only accounted for up to 30% of the newly maintained code.</p>
                    <p>Through this project, I practised extended development based on existing products. This kind of "build upon somebody's work" creation is far more effective than building the entire framework from scratch.</p>

                    <p>In the project, I created a well-structured MySQL / MS Access relational database (populated with sample data), a functional VB.NET windows application that interfaces with the database, and a detailed report with attractive typesetting.

                    <p>This SBA project was highly commended by my school instructor and received a grade of 99 out of 100 from the HKEAA.</p> 
                    <p>2017 marked the final session for project-based SBA. After that, projects were replaced with in-class guided tasks. I'm really thankful I had the opportunity to practice the entire development lifecycle in high school, turning theories into action.</p>
